# BlinkPlusCharge
A Windows app to remind users to blink, take breaks, and charge the laptop.

## Features
- **Battery Reminder:** Alerts when the battery level drops below a specified threshold.
- **Break Reminder:** Reminds you to take breaks at customizable intervals.
- **Blink Reminder:** Prompts you to blink to prevent eye strain.
- **Custom Sounds:** Use system sounds or custom WAV files for reminders.
- **Runs in the background** and starts as the laptop restarts.


## Usage
1. Launch `BlinkPlusCharge.exe` to open the settings window.
2. Configure your preferences:

3. Click **Save** to apply settings and start (as the background process)

 ** P.S:** (it will start automatically on the next system boots. To disable it, click "EndAutoRun"->will be removed from the registry).
